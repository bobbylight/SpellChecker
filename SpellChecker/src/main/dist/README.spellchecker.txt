By popular demand, here is a spell checker add-on for RSyntaxTextArea.  For
programming languages, it spell-checks text in comments, and when editing plain
text files, the entire file is spell-checked.  Spelling errors are
squiggle-underlined with the color of your choosing, and hovering the mouse
over a misspelled word displays a tooltip with suggested fixes (if any).

This add-on is based on Jazzy, a Java spell checker.  Indeed, 99% of the code
is just Jazzy, ever-so-slightly modified.  See http://jazzy.sourceforge.net
for more information about the Jazzy library.  Any modifications to the
original source can be found by searching for "robert:".

Included with this distribution is an English dictionary (both American and
British).  The easiest method to add spell checking to RSTA is as follows:

     import org.fife.ui.rsyntaxtextarea.spell.*;
     // ...
     File zip = new File("location/of/included/english_dic.zip");
     boolean american = true; // "false" will use British English
     SpellingParser parser = SpellingParser.
                                 createEnglishSpellingParser(zip, american);
     textArea.addParser(parser);

See class org.fife.ui.rsyntaxtextarea.spell.demo.SpellingParserDemo for a
working example.

If you wish to compile SpellChecker from source, the easiest way to do so
is via the included Ant build script.  The default target builds the jar.

This project depends on its sister RSyntaxTextArea project.  It is recommended
that you check the two projects out side by side.  Then, to build:
  
   cd RSyntaxTextArea
   gradlew build
   cd ../SpellChecker
   gradlew build
