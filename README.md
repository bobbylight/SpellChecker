SpellChecker is a spell check add-on for `RSyntaxTextArea`.  For programming languages, it spell-checks text in
comments, and when editing plain text files, the entire file is spell-checked.  Spelling errors are squiggle-underlined
in the color of your choosing, and hovering the mouse over a misspelled word displays a tool tip with suggested fixes
(if any).  You can configure the library to also use a "user dictionary" file, allowing the user to add extra words to
the spell check white list.

This add-on is based on [Jazzy](http://jazzy.sourceforge.net), a Java spell checker.  Indeed, 99% of the code is just
Jazzy, with changes made for performance, bug fixes, and Java 6 syntax.

Included with this distribution is an English dictionary (both US and
British).  The easiest method to add spell checking to RSTA is as follows:

```java
import org.fife.ui.rsyntaxtextarea.spell.*;
// ...
File zip = new File("location/of/included/english_dic.zip");
boolean usEnglish = true; // "false" will use British English
SpellingParser parser = SpellingParser.createEnglishSpellingParser(zip, usEnglish);
textArea.addParser(parser);
```

See class `org.fife.ui.rsyntaxtextarea.spell.demo.SpellingParserDemo` for a working example.  

Just like Jazzy itself, this add-on is licensed under the LGPL; see the included
