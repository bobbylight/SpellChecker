SpellChecker is a spell check add-on for `RSyntaxTextArea`.  For programming languages, it spell-checks text in
comments, and when editing plain text files, the entire file is spell-checked.  Spelling errors are squiggle-underlined
in the color of your choosing, and hovering the mouse over a misspelled word displays a tool tip with suggested fixes
(if any).  You can configure the library to also use a "user dictionary" file, allowing the user to add extra words to
the spell check white list.

This add-on is based on [Jazzy](http://jazzy.sourceforge.net), a Java spell checker.  Indeed, 99% of the code is just
Jazzy, with changes made for performance, bug fixes, and Java 8 syntax.

This library is built with Java 8.  Using a more recent version of Java will result in compile warnings,
but the build should still complete.  Cleaning up these warnings is not a priority as long as this library targets
Java 8.

## Getting a dictionary file
While the `SpellingParser` class can take any implementation of the `SpellDictionary` interface,
typically English users will use one of the `SpellingParser.createEnglishSpellingParser()`
overloads.  These overloads take a zip file containing `.dic` files for either American or British
English.  Such a zip file is generated by this library when running `./gradlew clean build` -
`src/main/dist/english_dic.zip`.  This file is not source controlled, but the `.dic` files that
make up its contents are, so we can easily track added words over time.

## Usage
As mentioned above, building this project builds an `english_dic.zip` file that can be used
for both American and British English spellchecking.  Using this zip file, the easiest
method to add spell checking to RSTA is as follows:

```java
import org.fife.ui.rsyntaxtextarea.spell.*;
// ...
File zip = new File("location/of/generated/english_dic.zip");
boolean usEnglish = true; // "false" will use British English
SpellingParser parser = SpellingParser.createEnglishSpellingParser(zip, usEnglish);
textArea.addParser(parser);
```

See the `SpellCheckerDemo` submodule for a working example.
